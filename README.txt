# Playbooks on Rails for Splunk (PORS)

Playbooks-On-Rails for Splunk (PORS) is a collection of ansible playbooks, roles & tasks for everything around Splunk.<br/>
Remembering all the playbook commands is not comfortable so PORS comes with a GUI (ncurses/dialog based) and a lot of nice features on top.

This app allows:
* some useful insights of playbooks which were run by PORS
* alerting for failed playbooks (predefined)
* alerting for anything else you want - related to Ansible playbooks used by PORS ;)
